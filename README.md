# Assessment-5

We write a smart contract to create our own token on the local hardhat network and we use Remix IDE to interact with it.

# Description

Hardhat is a development environment for Ethereum software, in order to work with it, we install the hardhat repository( named hardhat-boilerplate-master) on our system. Once the installation is done, we open the repository in VS Code. Under the contracts folder, we write our smart contract to be deployed. In the terminal, we install all the dependencies required for the hardhat, once it is done we write the command "npx hardhat node" to get all the addresses and keys of the tokens where we can deploy them. We open the Remix- Ethereum IDE we change the workspace to the localhost so that the hardhat can compile the contract, once it is done we enable the hardhat compilation option before we compile the contract. After compiling we will change the environment to Dev-Hardhat provider and copy the address from the terminal in the vs code and paste it under the account address, we deploy it. After deploying we will work with the functions mint and burn and also check the balance of the account of the particular address mentioned. In this way, we create our own token on a local hardhat and interact with it with the help of remix IDE.
